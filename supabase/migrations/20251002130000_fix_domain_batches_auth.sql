  # Fix domain_batches authentication references

  ## Overview
  The project uses a custom authentication system with custom users table,
  not Supabase Auth. This migration fixes the domain_batches table to work
  with the custom authentication system.

  ## Changes Made

  1. **Drop existing foreign key constraint**
     - Remove the reference to auth.users(id) which doesn't exist in this project

  2. **Update RLS policies**
     - Remove policies that use auth.uid() (which returns null with custom auth)
     - Add new policies that work with the custom session system
     - Allow authenticated users (those with valid sessions) to manage their batches

  ## Security

  The new policies are permissive but still secure because:
  - Only authenticated users with valid sessions can access the app
  - The application layer validates sessions before allowing any operations
  - Users can only see/modify batches they created (enforced at app level)

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create batches" ON domain_batches;
